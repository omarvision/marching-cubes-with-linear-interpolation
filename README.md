# marching-cubes-with-linear-interpolation
This is a duplicate of the other video, just with the voice sped up (cause I forgot to do it in the other video). 
Marching Cubes is a way to generate a procedural mesh by sampling the 3D volume are regular grid like cube (cell) intervals and making faces in each cell to outline the inside vs outside of shape.
Linear Interpolation is a way to pick points along the edges of the cube that pays attention to the strength of the numerical value assigned to the vertices of the cube (vs. just in the middle).
You see... when you watch the video :) 
The code is reuseable. It can be found at omarvision.com.
